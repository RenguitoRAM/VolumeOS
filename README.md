VolumeOS is the on-chain liquidity motion layer powering post-launch visibility for meme tokens, DAOs, and launchpads.  
Structured. Simulated. Telegram-native.

## 🧠 What is VolumeOS?

VolumeOS is the engine behind **Voluma's Smart Volume™**. It simulates human-like trade behavior—**buy → buy → sell**—using DEX aggregator routing to make tokens appear active, trending, and visible across:

- GeckoTerminal
- Raydium & Jupiter
- Solana explorers
- Telegram feeds & bots

No fake liquidity. No contract changes. No staking.  
Just programmable volume that moves tokens forward.
